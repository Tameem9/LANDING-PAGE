# LANDING-PAGE
* This is my landnding page for FWD first project 
*the code main idea is my Idea  
*I had a couple of difficulties so i searched how to do some of them then wrote them myself 
*first thing I did is to attach the js file to the html file 
*then I add the 4th section in the html file adn the scroll type 
*I startd working on the js file 
*first thing I declared the global variabls which are an array to read the sections from the document into an un ordered list 
*a variable camed menu to add list items 
*first function duty is to loop through the sections and get the section's names from data nav for to get the number of the section
*and to get the link attribute 
*adding them to the ul and linking them with an ancor for clicking 
*the onScroll function is done using the getBoundingByClientReact() 
*which gets the distance between the item and the top left corner of the page using a couple of if statements for position determination
